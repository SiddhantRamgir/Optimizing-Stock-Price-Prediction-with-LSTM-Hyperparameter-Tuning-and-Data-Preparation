Enhancing Stock Price Prediction with Long Short-Term Memory Networks: A Study of Hyperparameter Tuning and Data Preparation

### Summary

This research paper explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting stock prices, focusing on data preparation, model architecture, and the impact of hyperparameter tuning. By analyzing an existing Kaggle project, the study identifies and addresses challenges in data splitting and sequencing, enhancing the model with manual hyperparameter tuning.

#### Key Components:
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   - Historical stock data for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon were retrieved using the `yfinance` library.
   - Data cleaning and transformation included concatenation of individual stock DataFrames and the addition of a company name column.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) used visualizations to identify trends, moving averages, and daily return distributions.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Daily returns were calculated and correlation analysis conducted to understand relationships between stocks.

3. **LSTM Model Building:**
   - An LSTM model with two layers (128 and 64 units) was built using Keras.
   - Data was prepared for the LSTM by scaling, sequencing, and reshaping into a 3D format.
   - Model performance was evaluated using RMSE, showing the ability to capture long-term dependencies in stock prices.

4. **Improvements and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - The original modelâ€™s data splitting issues were resolved with a custom looping approach.
   - Manual hyperparameter tuning optimized LSTM units, epochs, batch size, and the choice of the Adam optimizer.
   - The improved model demonstrated better prediction accuracy, highlighting the significance of tuning in financial machine learning.

#### Conclusion:
LSTM networks, with proper data preparation and hyperparameter tuning, are effective tools for stock price prediction, capturing long-term dependencies and improving predictive performance. Future research could further explore extensive tuning, different architectures, and additional techniques to enhance model accuracy and robustness.
